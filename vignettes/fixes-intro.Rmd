## Introduction

The **fixes** package provides a set of tools for creating, estimating, and visualizing event study models using fixed effects regression. With **fixes**, you can easily generate lead and lag dummy variables, estimate a fixed effects model via `fixest::feols()`, and visualize the results using `ggplot2`.

This vignette walks you through a minimal example to demonstrate the core functionality of the package.

## Installation

You can install the released version from CRAN:

``` r
pak::pak("fixes")
```

Alternatively, you can use:

``` r
install.packages("fixes")
```

To install the development version directly from GitHub, run:

``` r
pak::pak("yo5uke/fixes")
```

or

``` r
devtools::install_github("yo5uke/fixes")
```

## A Minimal Example

Below is a simple example to simulate a small panel dataset and perform an event study analysis. In this example, we assume an event (treatment) occurs in 2005.

``` r
library(fixes)
library(tibble)
library(dplyr)

# Simulate panel data
set.seed(2)

n_firms <- 1000
n_states <- 50
T <- 36

firm_id <- 1:n_firms
state_id <- sample(n_states, size = n_firms, replace = TRUE)
year <- 1980:2015

fe_firm <- rnorm(n_firms, mean = 0, sd = .5)
fe_year <- rnorm(T, mean = 0, sd = .5)
error <- rnorm(n_firms * T, mean = 0, sd = .5)

treated_1998 <- sample(c(1, 0), size = n_firms,
                       replace = TRUE, prob = c(1/2, 1/2))

df <- tibble::tibble(
  firm_id = rep(firm_id, each = T),
  state_id = rep(state_id, each = T),
  year = rep(year, times = n_firms),
  fe_firm = rep(fe_firm, each = T),
  fe_year = rep(fe_year, times = n_firms),
  error = error,
  is_treated = rep(treated_1998, each = T),
  after_treat = dplyr::if_else(is_treated == 1 & year >= 1998, 1, 0),
  x1 = runif(n_firms * T),
  x2 = rnorm(n_firms * T),
  y = dplyr::case_when(
    after_treat == 1 ~
      rnorm(n_firms * T, mean = .3, sd = .2) * (year - 1997) + fe_firm + fe_year + error,
    .default = fe_firm + fe_year + error
  )
)

# Run the event study
event_study <- run_es(
  data       = df,
  outcome    = y,
  treatment  = is_treated,
  time       = year,
  timing     = 1998,
  lead_range = 18,
  lag_range  = 17,
  covariates = ~ x1 + x2,
  fe         = ~ firm_id + year,
  cluster    = ~ state_id,
  baseline   = -1,
  interval   = 1
)


# View the first few rows of the event study results
head(event_study)
```

## Visualizing the Event Study Results

The **fixes** package provides the `plot_es()` function to create visualizations of your event study results. Here are some examples:

``` r
# Basic plot using ribbon-style confidence intervals
p1 <- plot_es(event_study)
print(p1)

# Plot with error bars instead of a ribbon
p2 <- plot_es(event_study, type = "errorbar")
print(p2)

# Plot with a custom vertical reference line
p3 <- plot_es(event_study, type = "errorbar", vline_val = -0.5)
print(p3)

# Customized plot: adjust axis breaks and add a title
library(ggplot2)
p4 <- plot_es(event_study, type = "errorbar") + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(-5, 4, by = 1)) + 
  ggtitle("Result of Event Study")
print(p4)
```

## Handling Irregular Time Data

In some panel datasets, the time variable may not be regularly spaced â€” for example, it may be a `Date` column or have gaps between observations. In such cases, `run_es()` provides a convenient option: `time_transform = TRUE`.

When `time_transform` is set to `TRUE`, the function automatically creates a sequential time index (1, 2, 3, ...) within each unit (specified by the `unit` argument) and uses that index for the event study analysis. This is particularly useful when your original time variable is not integer-valued or has irregular spacing.

### Example using `Date` and `time_transform`

```r
df_alt <- df |>
  dplyr::mutate(date = as.Date(paste0(year, "-01-01")))

event_study_alt <- run_es(
  data           = df_alt,
  outcome        = y,
  treatment      = is_treated,
  time           = date,
  timing         = 19,        # Corresponds to the 19th time point per unit
  lead_range     = 3,
  lag_range      = 3,
  fe             = ~ firm_id + year,
  cluster        = ~ state_id,
  baseline       = -1,
  time_transform = TRUE,
  unit           = firm_id
)

head(event_study_alt)
```

***Note:*** when `time_transform = TRUE`, the `timing` argument must be specified as the index of the treated time point within each unit.

## Package Details

The **fixes** package is designed for panel data analysis and supports custom time intervals. Key functions include:

- `run_es()`:
    - Automatically generates lead and lag dummy variables relative to the treatment event.
    - Constructs and estimates a fixed effects regression model.
    - Accepts covariates specified as a one-sided formula (e.g., `~ x1 + x2`).
    - Fixed effects must also be specified as a one-sided formula (e.g., `~ id + year`).
    - Supports clustered standard errors:
        - You can specify clusters using either a character vector (e.g., `c("id", "year")`) or a one-sided formula (e.g., `~ id + year` or `~ id^year`).
        - The cluster variables are evaluated *after* subsetting the estimation sample to ensure compatibility.
    - Returns a tidy dataframe with estimated coefficients, standard errors, and confidence intervals.
    - `time_transform`: If `TRUE`, replaces the time variable with a sequential index within each unit (e.g., for irregular time variables like `Date`).
    - `unit`: Required when `time_transform = TRUE`. Specifies the panel unit ID (e.g., `firm_id`).


- `plot_es()`:
    - Provides a flexible visualization tool using `ggplot2`.
    - Offers both ribbon-style and error bar representations of confidence intervals.
    - Can be further customized with standard ggplot2 functions.

## Conclusion

The **fixes** package streamlines the process of performing event study analyses with fixed effects. It simplifies the estimation and visualization steps, making it easier to interpret dynamic treatment effects in panel data.
